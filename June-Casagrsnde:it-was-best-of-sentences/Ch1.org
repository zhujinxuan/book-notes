# Subordinates

Subordinates relegate phrases into a less critical place. It will cause confusion if you
put it the importance key point in the subordinates.

Grammar Trick:  Sometimes writers intentionally put abnormal incidents insides subordinates, 
to play up the weirdness that the abnormal incidents become normal under the context.  Example:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Ted Lavender, who was scared, carried tranquilizers until he was shot in his head outside the
village of Than Ken in mid April.
#+END_QUOTE

Conjugations can cause confusion when it has multiple meanings.  For example, the word 'while' can 
imply a time relation, as well as a logic relation by being a synonyms of 'although'.  Use it when
by
1. Only for its primary definition
2. When its primary meaning coincide with secondary meaning.

Do not use the word 'as'.  It has too many ambiguous meanings.
